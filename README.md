> `WarHub.ArmouryModel` library and `wham` tool

Foundational .NET library for wargame datafile tools, written in C#.

## Overview

This is the home of the `WarHub.ArmouryModel` library handling wargame roster and data files.
It consists of:

* `wham` - a CLI tool (Command Line) used to manage, convert and publish datafiles,
  distributed as .NET Global Tool (.NET SDK v7+ required)
* `WarHub.ArmouryModel.Source` library provides API to manage and interact
  with wargaming data files (game systems, catalogues) and rosters.
* `WarHub.ArmouryModel.Source.BattleScribe` provides convenient methods to load and save
  BattleScribe XML datafiles.
* `WarHub.ArmouryModel.ProjectModel` library provides API to operate on wham workspaces (abstraction)
  and their configuration (`.whamproj` configuration files).
* `WarHub.ArmouryModel.Workspaces.BattleScribe` implements project model for BattleScribe format.
* `WarHub.ArmouryModel.Workspaces.Gitree` implements project model for *gitree* where
  directory and file structure is a part of datafile shape, building datafile from massive amounts
  of tiny files. It's mostly designed to work well with VCS (Version Control Systems) such as **git**.

All libraries, unless otherwise specifed, target `.NET 6`.

There are also test projects and `WarHub.ArmouryModel.Source.CodeGeneration` project which contains
code generator used to build `.Source` library. This code generator uses C# Source Generators.

## Usage

### `wham` installation

To install `wham` command line tool:

1. please install [`.NET SDK` v7](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
  for your platform.
1. In your shell/command line run `dotnet tool install wham -g`
1. You can check if the tool is available: `wham --version` should show what version exactly is running.

This will install preview of `wham` CLI tool in your user-space (not system global),
and so it doesn't require root/admin permissions. (Although installation of .NET SDK can).

### `wham` features

* converts BattleScribe workspace (xml files: `.cat`/`.catz`/`.gst`/`.gstz`)
  into *gitree* workspace (mutliple small files in directory trees) that
  behaves with **git** well.
* publishes BattleScribe format distribution files:
  * `.bsr` repository distribution package - zip archive containing datafiles (`.cat` and `.gst`)
    and DataIndex `index.xml` file.
  * `index.bsi` which is DataIndex `index.xml`-containing zip archive.
  * `index.xml` DataIndex.
  * `.cat`/`.gst` datafiles
  * `.catz`/`.gstz` zipped datafiles

### `wham` usage

You can always run `wham -?` or `wham -h` or `wham [action] -?` to get help about the tool/action.

## Development

The development branch is the `main` branch. Stable releases are marked via `vX.Y.Z` tags.
This project uses `Nerdbank.GitVersioning` package that automatically generates version numbers
for assemblies and packages from git tree. It won't work if the git clone is *shallow* or otherwise
incomplete.
